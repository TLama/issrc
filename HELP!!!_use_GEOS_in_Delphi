TLama, Hello!

I looked for binding GEOS for Delphi and have found your messages:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2015-July/007199.html

You couldn't share your practices?
I, unfortunately, have no experience of porting of the C API in Delphi.

Sorry for bothering you. 
This is the only way to contact you
